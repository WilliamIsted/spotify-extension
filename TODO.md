## Starting Playlist

https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/start-a-users-playback

Use the context_uri of a playlist


## 2.0

It's going to require the user create a new application with a redirect uri matching our host.


### Deck

Add a "reset client id" button to the deck. This will allow the user to reset the client id and token if they need to.

### Leverage SAMMI local api

We can use OUR API to post into a local API once they give us a client_id/token
